<p>It is generally difficult for manual wheelchair (MWC) users to engage in daily physical activities; this is especially true when navigating complex environments or participating in adaptive sports, where the user must master various skills (e.g., changing direction, lifting the front wheels, etc.). Besides being challenging, these situations generate significant joint loads, leading to over 50% of users developing shoulder pain. The laboratory uses biomechanics as an approach to better understand the causes of these problems and the best ways to prevent them.</p>
<h2 id="axis-1---technological-development">Axis 1 - Technological Development</h2>
<p>The biomechanics of wheelchair propulsion is a little-known field, and the necessary instruments for understanding and developing innovative interventions do not yet exist. <strong>The first research axis</strong> of the laboratory aims to develop the technologies needed to measure the biomechanics of wheelchair propulsion in real or simulated conditions. This translates into various technological development projects:</p>

<h2 id="axis-2---biomechanical-analysis">Axis 2 - Biomechanical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>The second research axis</strong> of the laboratory aims to use these tools to better understand the biomechanical impacts of wheelchair mobility and sports on the musculoskeletal system. A better understanding of these impacts will help therapists optimize the positioning and training of MWC users and help coaches implement training programs that minimize the risk of developing various musculoskeletal disorders. Among the projects in this axis are:</p>

<td><strong>Characterization of asymmetry on lateral slopes</strong>: One of the mobility challenges for manual wheelchair users is propulsion on sidewalks, because their lateral inclination drives the wheelchair towards the street. We characterized the effect of lateral inclination on propulsion force asymmetry and proposed an index to measure this asymmetry.</td>

<td><strong>Biomechanical and ergonomic analysis of forward and backward propulsions in wheelchair badminton</strong>: Wheelchair badminton is a recent sport whose biomechanics have rarely been studied. This sport is characterized by predominant forward-backward movement interspersed with stops.

<h3 id="axis-3---promotion-of-biomechanical-analysis">Axis 3 - Promotion of Biomechanical Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>The third research axis</strong> of the laboratory aims to promote and democratize biomechanics. Biomechanics is a multidisciplinary field often considered difficult by students, limiting the number of future researchers choosing this field. This is particularly evident in wheelchair biomechanics. To empower students and researchers who do not have training in programming and biomechanics, my laboratory created the Kinetics Toolkit project:</p>
<p><img alt="project_picture" src="/fr/research/pictures/kineticstoolkit.png"></p>
<p>(1)   an open-source Python package that facilitates and automates the processing of biomechanical data (e.g., time series, events, temporal and frequency filtering, resampling, cycles, management of acquisition files, 3D geometric operations, interactive visualization, kinematic reconstruction).</p>
<p>(2)   an electronic book that teaches biomechanical data processing to new users, starting with basic Python programming up to complex 3D operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca">https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca</a></p>
<p>It is now used in graduate courses worldwide and is continuously gaining popularity, with over 1000 user-days of use per month, and over 50,000 website visits per month: <a href="https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca/usagestats.html">https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca/usagestats.html</a></p>
