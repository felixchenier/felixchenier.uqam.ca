The Mobility and Adaptive Systems Research Lab's mission is to increase fundamental knowledge on the biomechanical interactions between the person, their technical aid and their environment in a context of mobility and practice of adapted sports.

Such new knowledge, acquired through the development and use of new technologies, is essential to better understand the mechanisms of injury development and the effect of adaptations (eg, positioning, sizing, specific training) on performance, risk of injury, and benefits of adapted physical activity in a functional rehabilitation setting.

❗️ [We are currently looking for students in many projects](/studying).
